            <div class="project-date">May 2013</div>

            <p>This project was a nice change from my day-to-day activities at Infragistics, I got the opportunity to design a few posters for the office that reflect the activities of our in-house interest groups. Three poster designs in total, for the Cooking, Book and User Experience clubs. The purpose of the posters is not only to marketeering the groups themselves, but having a light recruitement note as well.</p>
