# panev.net portfolio page


A work-in-progress personal portfolio website. Uses a lot of custom css animations and imagery, not ideal for templating.

Currently a good portion of the site is complete, however there are still areas that are being worked on—namely proper responsiveness and touch screen optimization—also most of the portfolio projects aren't added yet.

Feel free to clone and poke around, though. :-)

### php

Currently I use php_require to modularize html markup, so you're going to need something like XAMPP/MAMPP or Apache to get going (sorry about that). A proper template engine will be used in the (hopefully near) future.

## Installation

```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

```sh
grunt watch
```
