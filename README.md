=========

A work-in-progress personal portfolio website.


Currently a good portion of the site is complete, however there are still areas that are quite unfinished and unpolished—namely proper responsiveness, touch screen optimization, header behaviour and all around visuals—also most of the portfolio projects aren't added yet.

Feel free to clone and poke around, though. :-)

Oh, and I use php for modularizing my markup. Fairly limited usage of php_require for different html bits that I reuse throughout the site ( head, navigation, footer, etc). You're going to need something like XAMPP to run apache and serve the php.
